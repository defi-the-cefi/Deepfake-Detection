## 3. Write a simple (supervised) deep classifier to train and test using the dataset
collected in Q1.

* a. How will you divide your dataset into training and test sets.

70/100 train, 15/100 validation, 15/100 test, with 50/50 fake, real images in each 

* b. What data-augmentation techniques will to use for out-of-distribution (unseen) images?

Random crop, Random Flip, Random Invert, Random Rotate, Random Sharpness Adjust, Random Contrast Adjust

* c. Please test accuracy on the attached, rd_test_dataset zipped face images, and save the output to a .csv file.
